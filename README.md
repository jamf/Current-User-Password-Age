# Current User Password Age

## What were we trying to solve?

Everyone at JAMF Software is a local admin of their own Mac (we do not bind to AD). For reporting purposes we needed to know the age of the password of their local user account so we could take action on the results if it fell outside of our policies.

## What does it do?

This script runs as an extension attribute. It extracts data from the dscl record of the currently logged in user and, based upon one of two timestamps, calculates the age of their password in days (the location of the timestamp differs between OS X 10.9 and OS X 10.10 clients, and/or if a client has changed their password since upgrading from 10.9 to 10.10).

## How to deploy this script as an extension attribute

Upload the script to your JSS in your extension attributes. Set the value for "Data Type" to "Integer". This script has been tested against 10.9 and 10.10 clients.
